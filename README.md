# fundo
## Find nearby events that interest you without getting bogged down by those who don't. 

This is a project for RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source), built with Meteor and React.

### Description
fundo is a web application which will allow users to discover nearby events. It's main focus is on being an event discovery tool, and the plan is for it to be tinder-like. Users will be able to upvote and like events, and the system will learn user preferences and recommend nearby events that the user is likely to attend. In time, the event suggestions should improve as users provide more data points for the recommendation algorithm. We will also recommend events to users based on what other users with similar preferences have also liked. The goal of this project is to create a one-stop shop to find something to do if youâ€™re bored, and only provide events that users are interested in attending.

### Timeline
- [ ] Week 1-2: Finalize app design. Look into recommendation algorithms and get complete feature list of what we want to implement. 

- [ ] Weeks 3-4: Rough app skeleton, integrate event APIs to draw event data from. Implement event cache and figure out how to manage the data.

- [ ] Weeks 5-6: Play around with recommendation systems. Improve app infrastructure. Test recommendations using mock users with different preferences.

- [ ] Weeks 7-8: Implement bulk of recommendation system. Plug into recommendation apis and figure out how to parse events to extract important/relevant data.

- [ ] Weeks 9-10: Get a working frontend up. Fix backend issues, continued development. Fine tune recommendations.

- [ ] Week 11: Squash dem bugs by thoroughly testing features. Continued work on frontend features and backend recommendations. Possibly look at more apis to plug into.

- [ ] Week 12: Release to the public. Be happy.
